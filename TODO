// object can be a bag, seq, or alt container of values
// value literals are a string+type		http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#built-in-datatypes

* Work on sparql support:
	- get the simplest possible query working
	- probably want to use queries from w3c tests
	- make sure that the feature we have an immediate need for are all supported
* May want to update readme.
* See if we can do a better job now with stuff like date.
* Add a sparql parser:
	- don't need the full thing for now

* Get the types setup.
	- rename predicate relation?
* Run the w3c tests:
	- http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/
	- will need a turtle parser
* IRIs must be absolute (i.e. they must have a scheme name followed by a colon).
* Language tags must be non-empty and normalized to lower case.
* Should we have primitive or functions like get_i32_value?
* Triple equality:
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-IRIs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-Literal-Equality
* Should support CURIEs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf-interfaces-20110510/#terms--prefixes-and-profiles
* Maybe want a (mutable) hashmap based tiplet store
	- subject => [(relation, object)]
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf-interfaces-20110510/#graphs
* Will need a way to merge two triple sets
	- need to fixup blank nodes
* Might want a graph type, possibly based on a (hidden) hashset
* Maybe add some query methods
	- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework#Query_and_inference_languages
* Add a turtle parser.

SELECT ?x
WHERE {subject predicate object}

can use ?x to name a wildcard argument
IRIs appear as <http://foo/bar#blah>
strings as "foo"

WHERE can have multiple patterns
matches triples that match all the patterns
variable matches must match the same value

pattern can be appended with FILTER
FILTER regex(?x, "foo|bar") filters out triples that aren't foo/bar
FILTER NOT EXISTS {pattern} filters out triples that match pattern
FILTER EXISTS {pattern} filters out triples that don't match pattern
	does not add bindings (tho they nay be used)
FILTER (?age >= 24)

OPTIONAL {pattern}
adds a binding
binding may not actually have a value

pattern UNION pattern
returns triples that match either pattern
if distinct bindings are used then the unmatched binding won't have a value

ORDERBY ?x ?y	sort results
DISTINCT			don't return duplicate rows
OFFSET/LIMIT	slice results
ASK				return true/false instead of matches/no matches
	
STRSTARTS
STRENDS
CONTAINS
