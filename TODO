* Support AS in select clause.

* SHould be able to support regex functions using regexec.
* Work on more complex matching:
	- may want to support union
* Select components can be strings?
	- if not why does triple pattern allow literals?
* Need to make sure solutions are not being copied willy nilly.
* Check some common parse errors and add tag as needed.
* Document whats not supported:
	- paths
	- collections
	- etc
* Do we need to be able to match collections?
* Concepts doc at 307 talks about escaping urls.
* Support common subjects and common prefixes (4.2.1 and 4.2.2)
* When we support lists we'll also need to support in and not in operators.

* Run the w3c tests:
	- http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/
	- will need a turtle parser and xml and probably more
* IRIs must be absolute (i.e. they must have a scheme name followed by a colon).
* Triple equality:
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-IRIs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-Literal-Equality
* Should support CURIEs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf-interfaces-20110510/#terms--prefixes-and-profiles
* Will need a way to merge two triple sets
	- need to fixup blank nodes
* Optimization:
	- http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~cgutierr/papers/tods09.pdf
* Add a turtle parser.
