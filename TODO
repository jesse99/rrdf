[68] ExpressionList ::= NIL | '(' Expression ( ',' Expression )* ')'

[66] FunctionCall ::= IRIref ArgList


* Work on more complex matching:
	- support filter inside of optional
	- may want to support union
* Support group by and limit.
* Select components can be strings?
	- if not why does triple pattern allow literals?
* Need to make sure solutions are not being copied willy nilly.
* Check some common parse errors and add tag as needed.
* Document whats not supported:
	- paths
	- collections
	- etc
* Do we need to be able to match collections?
* Concepts doc at 307 talks about escaping urls.
* Support common subjects and common prefixes (4.2.1 and 4.2.2)
* WHen we support lists we'll also need to support in and not in operators.
* Add a unit test demonstrating that solutions can be sent across tasks.
* Add a unit test showing that add_triples args can be sent across threads.
* Get more queries working:
	- make sure that the features we have an immediate need for are all supported
	- 1402 has a nav example
		` apply second rule to results of the first rule?
	- can do queries with http://dbpedia.org/sparql
* Work on more stuff:
	- remove
	- clean
	- add_store
* May want to update readme.
* See if we can do a better job now with stuff like date.
* Add a sparql parser:
	- don't need the full thing for now
* May want to add to cargo.

* Run the w3c tests:
	- http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/
	- will need a turtle parser and xml and probably more
* IRIs must be absolute (i.e. they must have a scheme name followed by a colon).
* Triple equality:
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-IRIs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf11-concepts-20110830/#section-Literal-Equality
* Should support CURIEs
	- http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-rdf-interfaces-20110510/#terms--prefixes-and-profiles
* Will need a way to merge two triple sets
	- need to fixup blank nodes
* Optimization:
	- http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~cgutierr/papers/tods09.pdf
* Add a turtle parser.
